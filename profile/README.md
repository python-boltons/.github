Inspired by the original [gh:mahmoud/boltons][1] GitHub repository /
[boltons][3] PyPI package (founded ~10 years ago), this organization takes a
modern approach to solving the same problem.  Namely, while we strive to adhere
(more-or-less) to the design tenets of the original project, we choose to
utilize separate GitHub repositories and separate PyPI packages for each
cohesive set of library utilities.

The original project's architecture statement can be found [here][2]; we
summarize the design tenets found on that page below:

1. Be pure-Python and as self-contained as possible.
1. Perform a common task or fulfill a common role.
1. Demonstrate and mitigate some insufficiency in the standard library.
1. Strive for the standard set forth by the standard library by striking a
   balance between best practice and “good enough”, correctness and common
   sense. When in doubt, ask, “what would the standard library do?”
1. Have approachable documentation with at least one helpful doctest, links to
   relevant standard library functionality, as well as any 3rd-party packages
   that provide further capabilities.
